1
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.629
David Ornelas: So, Dr. Smudges. We know who you are, but what is your name and your research interests

2
00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:28.340
Logan Smilges: My name is Logan Smilges, and when I publish I usually tack on the 1st initial of my 1st name Jay, and my research interests kind of hover around queer and trans disability studies, rhetorical studies, and the history of medicine

3
00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:40.579
David Ornelas: Although your career science on disability and rhetical absence book was really big, how did that like? What was your journey that sparked that? And then going into crypt negativity, and the rest of your books

4
00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.876
Logan Smilges: Oh, goodness! Well,

5
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:59.230
Logan Smilges: queer silence! My 1st book was loosely based on my dissertation. I would say about 50% of my dissertation found its way into the book.

6
00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:17.280
Logan Smilges: and I note that because my dissertation was very much the culmination of a series of questions that led me to grad school. To begin with, I spent a good deal of my adolescence in conversion therapy

7
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:19.520
Logan Smilges: which

8
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:42.799
Logan Smilges: offered me a deeply harmful but nevertheless comprehensive framework to think about the relationship between sexuality and disability, and after finishing and in many ways surviving conversion therapy, I was left with a lot of questions about about that relationship

9
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:59.540
Logan Smilges: between well, my own experience of sexuality and disability, notwithstanding the disabilities I have that are somewhat independent, or not necessarily as intimately connected to my sexuality. And so

10
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:15.340
Logan Smilges: I entered grad school, really wanting to understand better what I experienced and how the language that we have to talk about disability and sexuality, particularly in relation.

11
00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:23.890
Logan Smilges: can shape what people experience on an embodied level of these kind of identities.

12
00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.652
Logan Smilges: And so queer silence.

13
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:47.369
Logan Smilges: Was an attempt to answer a lot of those questions. And in the dissertation the kind of 1st iteration of that project I was really primarily focused on sexuality and thinking about how people

14
00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.579
Logan Smilges: within sexual minorities

15
00:02:50.870 --> 00:03:12.480
Logan Smilges: have to drum up strategies to survive that don't always seem or register to others as particularly radical or resilient, but nevertheless are highly effective at keeping people alive or keeping people safe. And then.

16
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.669
Logan Smilges: when I I finished

17
00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:24.069
Logan Smilges: graduate school and move toward the book, I I felt a lot more freedom to think a little more expansively

18
00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:40.009
Logan Smilges: about not only the relationship between queerness and silence or sexuality and silence, but also disability, which, of course, is really the primary focus of the book iteration of the project.

19
00:03:40.633 --> 00:03:45.469
Logan Smilges: And and since queer silence, I have continued to be

20
00:03:45.610 --> 00:04:00.909
Logan Smilges: really invested in questions about solidarity, questions about being together in difference about coalition, because something that I

21
00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:07.069
Logan Smilges: learned in the process of writing queer silence was that the

22
00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:26.159
Logan Smilges: tension that we see in the historical record between queer people and disabled people is not. It was one, a persistent tension, one that continues to structure the relationship between queerness and disability

23
00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.759
Logan Smilges: on a kind of rhetorical level.

24
00:04:29.558 --> 00:04:41.070
Logan Smilges: But it's also one that has really deep implications, for how queer disabled people understand themselves. How I understand myself.

25
00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:42.760
Logan Smilges: And so

26
00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:52.089
Logan Smilges: I have continued to to write projects, to, to work on projects, including crypt negativity, and and some of my

27
00:04:52.190 --> 00:05:20.480
Logan Smilges: work since then that tries to take really seriously the feeling of tension, the kind of embodied feeling of contradiction and discomfort that comes along with occupying either multiple communities or multiple identities that don't always get along as well as we would like them to

28
00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:46.930
David Ornelas: Not to cut you off, and I know queer silence is the focus of this, but I remember in reading the 1st chapter or so of crypt negativity. You talk about your own experience in high school and the things you went through, and I wanted to touch base on that, because I feel that relates a lot to the queer silence and disability the bodies you mentioned in your book for queer silence. How are they mediated through technology? Does bodies serve one or many purposes that you're conveying in your book?

29
00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:57.000
Logan Smilges: Well, I think to answer that 1st question about bodies being mediated

30
00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:05.940
Logan Smilges: through or by technology requires that we really define what we mean by body and what we mean by technology.

31
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:25.221
Logan Smilges: There is, of course, a chapter of that book, arguably the central chapter of that book that's thinking about Grindr and as a technology that you know a number that lots of users are negotiating their own bodiedness, embodiedness

32
00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:32.640
Logan Smilges: through and in and in that chapter I

33
00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:42.730
Logan Smilges: claim or argue that that app, and particularly the kind of visuality

34
00:06:43.150 --> 00:07:09.400
Logan Smilges: of bodies on that app, is in one of the important ways in which silence can be instrumentalized by queer people. As a way to modulate how much of ourselves we want to disclose at any given time, and that, regardless of how much we want to disclose technologies such as Grindr. And I think there are lots of other examples we can

35
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.430
Logan Smilges: include.

36
00:07:12.385 --> 00:07:21.085
Logan Smilges: I'll allow folks to continue to be in community with one another. To at least some degree. And so

37
00:07:22.445 --> 00:07:33.450
Logan Smilges: I think more broadly. Then there's a way that technology allows a degree of togetherness

38
00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:46.590
Logan Smilges: that can often be inaccessible for people who occupy bodies that are heavily stigmatized, heavily marginalized, heavily surveilled, and thus

39
00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:53.924
Logan Smilges: encounter obstacles to to gathering in in community.

40
00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:58.749
Logan Smilges: now that all said, I think

41
00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:04.360
Logan Smilges: I think there's also a degree to which

42
00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:29.659
Logan Smilges: technology doesn't only serve as a mediation between bodies, but can also serve as an extension or essential component of bodies. And in this way I'm thinking of forms of prosthesis, whether physical prosthesis through like

43
00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:42.869
Logan Smilges: through like technological limbs. But or hearing aids, or also through other forms of assisted communication.

44
00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:55.529
Logan Smilges: that are also kind of technologically robust. So in these cases, I I back. I would back away a little bit from thinking about

45
00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:05.185
Logan Smilges: technology as a mediation, and lean more into a kind of embodied extension, because for lots of disabled people,

46
00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:25.690
Logan Smilges: technology becomes a really intimate part of how they understand themselves. Folks like Alison Kafer and Jillian Vicea have written a lot about figures of crypt cyborgs that are such good examples of the the real

47
00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:32.410
Logan Smilges: harmony that can take place between between bodies and technology.

48
00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:45.619
David Ornelas: You and I have been speaking, I think, since like 2021, and my master's thesis at Sdsu was on Grindr, and I heavily resonated with what you wrote about on Chris has especially the chapter on Grindr.

49
00:09:45.700 --> 00:10:08.589
David Ornelas: because what I wrote about my thesis was like the misconceptions that gay men have other gay men while on grinder in this digital space, where you don't know the person, you only see them through their profile picture and the bio they have, and whatever information they've included in that which leads into my next question is through your writing. Do you talk about queer digital spaces? And how do people embody them?

50
00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:14.870
Logan Smilges: Can. Can you ask that? The the kind of tail end of that question? One more time

51
00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:21.869
David Ornelas: Yes. So through your writing, you talk about current digital spaces, but how do they embody them?

52
00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:25.290
Logan Smilges: How do people occupy these queer digital spaces?

53
00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:26.060
David Ornelas: Yes.

54
00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:33.210
Logan Smilges: Well, there's such a range, right? And I think this is one of the things that can make.

55
00:10:34.102 --> 00:10:36.330
Logan Smilges: Queer digital spaces

56
00:10:36.410 --> 00:11:01.849
Logan Smilges: on the one hand, so promising and enlivening, and also deeply frustrating for people who use them. You know, it's so rare to encounter a queer person who's like I love the apps, the apps make me so happy, you know. I just can't wait to finish my day at work. Sit down and get on the apps like nobody. Nobody says that right.

57
00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:24.628
Logan Smilges: Everyone is upset about the apps. No one likes them, and yet they are so widely popular. Now, I'll be honest with you. I actually have not used like a queer dating app. Since, like 2017, it has been. It's been a long time since I have actively used them myself.

58
00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:28.780
Logan Smilges: that, said they.

59
00:11:29.742 --> 00:11:33.620
Logan Smilges: They continue to shape

60
00:11:33.710 --> 00:12:00.753
Logan Smilges: my life because of how pervasively they're used in community right? It is increasingly strange for queer people to meet one another, Irl for the 1st time. Right? Even if it's not an app like Grindr, it'll be another app like Instagram or Tiktok, right? Like the like. Social media specifically, has become such a dominant way that

61
00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:06.630
Logan Smilges: that people meet one another. And so, as a result.

62
00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:20.700
Logan Smilges: people bring lots of different expectations into these queer digital spaces. And I think this is what can often lead to the frustration that people feel

63
00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:24.749
Logan Smilges: specifically on apps like

64
00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:36.300
Logan Smilges: Grindr jacked tinder. Where the line between a sex app and a dating app can become a little blurry.

65
00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:57.479
Logan Smilges: It can be really not only confusing, but angering for some folks when another person is using the platform in a way that does not align with their own expectations for how they want to use the platform, or how they were hoping others will use the platform. And this.

66
00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:00.590
Logan Smilges: you know, this is no more clear.

67
00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:29.150
Logan Smilges: This becomes no more evident than when you can read in people's bios their frustrations when they itemize all the things that they do or don't want from others who interact with them. Right? Sometimes they itemize certain physical characteristics, often in like deeply racist and problematic and ableist transphobic ways, but also sometimes they will.

68
00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:50.669
Logan Smilges: They will list expectations that aren't directly or explicitly linked to certain forms of embodiment, but nevertheless set out expectations for how one presents themself visibly, authentically, comprehensively, on the platform. And if this is

69
00:13:51.420 --> 00:14:12.569
Logan Smilges: You know, this starts to get into what I write about in clear silence about the kinds of profile pictures that people include. There's increasingly an expectation that people will show their face that people will be transparent with their whole identity right up front. And when people fail to do that, when a user fails to do that. It can spark lots of feelings

70
00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:14.010
David Ornelas: Yeah.

71
00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:14.640
Logan Smilges: There is.

72
00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:39.378
David Ornelas: Both you and I know Grindr, I would say, is 99.9 9% a hookup app. But, like you said the way they men on the app, or try and body who they are is maybe not who they really are, but maybe to attract other men. And then I also feel you go to other dating apps, like, for example, hinge, and you have gay men on there. I think the premise of what men are looking for is completely different than what they're seeking on. Grindr.

73
00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:49.510
Logan Smilges: Absolutely well, and I think even when we call an app like Grindr, a hookup app.

74
00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:57.749
Logan Smilges: what a hookup entails is still so variable, you know, and

75
00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:24.280
Logan Smilges: you know, for example, there are a lot of disabled people whose interest and I guess this isn't even restricted to disabled people. But I'm thinking about disabled folks because of my own kind of community commitments. But for a lot of folks like virtual sex is the most accessible form of sex for them, or for, like, you know, for these folks like

76
00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:34.289
Logan Smilges: a hookup means sexting right, whereas for other users they will complain about endless conversations.

77
00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:56.780
Logan Smilges: Right? It's like, when are we gonna meet? When are we gonna get to the point? Right? So even if we were to agree that Grindr is a hookup app, which I'm still not convinced everyone thinks it is, but even if we were to agree that Grindr is a hookup app, it still leaves us with so much room for disagreement. And I don't think disagreement is bad at all. What

78
00:15:57.990 --> 00:16:05.859
Logan Smilges: I think the reason that people are so frustrated feel so intensely about difference

79
00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:15.360
Logan Smilges: on kind of or in queer digital spaces is because they they they expect like

80
00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:25.790
Logan Smilges: homogeny, you know, they they expect a kind of universal purpose. For these spaces, which

81
00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:31.369
Logan Smilges: has always been strange to me, because it is so counter to what

82
00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:45.599
Logan Smilges: queers have always been like when we gather. You know, we are always just. We're defined by our difference. So it should make sense that we're not going to be the same among one another. You know

83
00:16:46.130 --> 00:17:02.140
David Ornelas: Yeah. Do you incorporate your own lived experiences from your book or books or questions within your teaching? I don't mean, like not. Do you like directly. Talk about grandeur in your classes. But do you? Do you talk about your own lived experiences in your in your teaching?

84
00:17:04.122 --> 00:17:32.370
Logan Smilges: Yes, when relevant something I really stress to students at all levels is the importance of being able to articulate your position in relation to the topic at hand. Whether this is a conversation we're having, or an essay that we're writing, it's so

85
00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:37.230
Logan Smilges: essential that we're able to articulate

86
00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:50.929
Logan Smilges: the stakes of the of the topic for us. Right? Why do we care? Why are we interested? Why should we be trusted as an authority about Xyz? And in order to.

87
00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:53.919
Logan Smilges: in order to state those stakes.

88
00:17:54.420 --> 00:18:08.949
Logan Smilges: I find it very useful to be transparent about my lived experiences, and I like that. You use the phrase, lived experiences rather than just identities. Because.

89
00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:21.730
Logan Smilges: as as I write about pretty regularly, I'm very suspicious of the way that identity is increasingly used as a kind of synecdoche for politics.

90
00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:34.730
Logan Smilges: right? Or used as a synecdote key for authority on a particular topic. And and that's not at all what I want to do when I position myself

91
00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:37.739
David Ornelas: How do you incorporate diversity and inclusion within your teaching?

92
00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:40.180
Logan Smilges: Diversity and inclusion.

93
00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:41.650
David Ornelas: Yeah, within your teaching.

94
00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:43.955
Logan Smilges: Well,

95
00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:50.320
Logan Smilges: On a couple of different registers one would be

96
00:18:50.630 --> 00:19:05.150
Logan Smilges: curricularly. It's really important to me that my syllabi not only include, but center minoritarian voices.

97
00:19:05.929 --> 00:19:17.130
Logan Smilges: On whatever I'm teaching, I predominantly teach disability studies and trans studies courses. And so within within those

98
00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:38.399
Logan Smilges: courses, I'm not only trying to present, you know, the category of disability or the category of transness as this kind of as these kind of like monolithic silos, but trying to think about trying to think intersectionally about folks who continue to be marginalized even within these communities, and then

99
00:19:38.480 --> 00:20:01.039
Logan Smilges: centering or kind of trying to de-center those folks who consistently occupy most privileged positions within those communities. Right? So in the disability studies course, for instance, it's important to me that I really center indigenous black crip of color voices.

100
00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:09.329
Logan Smilges: because as as you know. Well, if I if any of us

101
00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:25.400
Logan Smilges: do not actively center those margins, then those margins continue to remain obsolete, or continue to remain voiceless in the conversation. So that's that's 1 way that I incorporate it another way, though.

102
00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:31.566
Logan Smilges: pertains more to pedagogical strategies that I use?

103
00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:44.820
Logan Smilges: so I I go to to somewhat great lengths, to design classroom activities that that

104
00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:57.451
Logan Smilges: ask students to do the very work that I was just describing in in response to the last question about positioning themselves in relation to the topic.

105
00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:11.680
Logan Smilges: right now, I'm teaching something of a history of transmedicine course. And I I teach this a version of this course every year, and one of the challenges that

106
00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:17.919
Logan Smilges: appears most regularly is that cisgender students who, just

107
00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:28.839
Logan Smilges: because of demographics, tend to be most of the students in the class. They like don't know how to participate because they feel

108
00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:35.269
Logan Smilges: they feel as though the topic is so distant

109
00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:39.820
Logan Smilges: from their own lived experience. And so

110
00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:47.300
Logan Smilges: I find it. I find that part of my responsibility as an educator is to really

111
00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:52.600
Logan Smilges: is to really push students to think about

112
00:21:52.720 --> 00:22:09.849
Logan Smilges: categories like transness as an effect of systems of power rather than just as a kind of innate, essential identity, and so helping students to position themselves within systems of

113
00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:18.980
Logan Smilges: like kind of or position themselves within sex gender systems and be able to be able to help them

114
00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:37.649
Logan Smilges: see their own proximity to power, to articulate their own proximity to power, which, of course, is never a 0 sum kind of game. All of us have kind of shifting proximities to power. That to me is like

115
00:22:39.070 --> 00:23:06.439
Logan Smilges: the go, the goal, the central goal of of teaching, because if students are able to articulate their own position in the world. It is so much easier for them to understand their relationships with others which can help them know when it's when it's time to speak up, when it's time to take a backseat, when it's time to listen and and learn. So

116
00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:21.050
Logan Smilges: I like to think that I'm I'm thinking about diversity and inclusion, maybe not using those words per se, but thinking about the ideas related to diversity and inclusion on both the kind of curricular and pedagogical levels

117
00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:32.630
David Ornelas: You talk a lot about silence within your book. How can educators incorporate the concept of silence as a rhetorical strategy, both in writing and through communication and curricula.

118
00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:40.730
Logan Smilges: Well, I think

119
00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:50.309
Logan Smilges: writing communication and curricular are kind of like all very different. So silence is going to look different in each of those contexts.

120
00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:59.530
Logan Smilges: but one thing that perhaps links the 3 of them is the fact that

121
00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:15.920
Logan Smilges: I don't understand silence purely as verbal silence, and I certainly don't understand it purely as emptiness. But instead, I think about silence as

122
00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:19.160
Logan Smilges: as

123
00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:41.729
Logan Smilges: a kind of multimodal absence, or it can appear across various modalities, and I also think about silence as gestural right. So the absence of one modality is always already a gesture toward the presence of another modality. And so

124
00:24:44.246 --> 00:24:57.370
Logan Smilges: across writing, communication and curricula. Then I would really encourage educators to think about how 1st

125
00:24:57.490 --> 00:25:13.550
Logan Smilges: their own silences are being how their own silences can create opportunities for other forms of presence.

126
00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:25.759
Logan Smilges: Right? Just as I was saying before, it's important that students learn when to listen, when to kind of sit down. It's also important, too, I think, for educators to be able to

127
00:25:27.910 --> 00:25:35.239
Logan Smilges: to, not to not feel as though they have to speak on everything all the time, but actually

128
00:25:36.850 --> 00:25:47.009
Logan Smilges: kind of instrumentalize silence as a way of inviting forms of presence from students or or from others.

129
00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:51.839
Logan Smilges: In my writing I I like to think about

130
00:25:52.516 --> 00:25:56.339
Logan Smilges: silence with regard to my citation. Politics.

131
00:25:57.330 --> 00:26:00.295
Logan Smilges: you know. There are times when

132
00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:13.700
Logan Smilges: citation is such a beautiful way of not only like amplifying voices. But it's also a way of acknowledging our own authorial limits

133
00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:34.059
Logan Smilges: and say like this actually isn't a topic that I feel as though I have the authority to like speak on by myself. And so I'm going to intentionally engage with citation as a way to bring in people who are experts or people who are who do have certain experiences so that they can

134
00:26:34.828 --> 00:26:37.550
Logan Smilges: like, kind of take on that role.

135
00:26:40.790 --> 00:26:46.010
Logan Smilges: But yeah, but it. But again trying to

136
00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:51.089
Logan Smilges: create something of a through line between writing communication and curricula.

137
00:26:51.370 --> 00:26:57.839
Logan Smilges: I think it's really useful to emphasize Silence's multimodality

138
00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:04.219
David Ornelas: I love that you don't just center it on just like you said at the beginning of it, just being silenced like. It's much more than that.

139
00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:10.490
David Ornelas: especially in academia. And you use that example of some students just sitting back and maybe just listening

140
00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:19.299
David Ornelas: and speaking up when they feel you know they want to contribute and stuff like that. But I appreciate you saying the silence is beyond just being quiet in space.

141
00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:34.480
David Ornelas: Shifting a little bit to online writing spaces. People do engage in silent discourse with that being said, does this complicate our understanding of identity and rhetorical silence in digital spaces

142
00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:42.059
Logan Smilges: Could I? Could I ask you to to expand a little bit on what you mean by silent discourse?

143
00:27:42.560 --> 00:28:00.850
David Ornelas: Yes, so I think I'm kind of referring also to again what you just said about silence within the classroom from cisgender students who maybe like not that they don't relate to the curriculum being taught, but they just feel like there's a distance between them and the curriculum in the class. So the silent discourse. That's kind of what I'm referring to.

144
00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:07.739
Logan Smilges: Okay. So folks who are participating in the discourse through their silence

145
00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:08.300
David Ornelas: Yeah.

146
00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:09.590
Logan Smilges: Yeah.

147
00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:13.200
Logan Smilges: Okay.

148
00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:34.320
Logan Smilges: I mean, I think one of the one of the more challenging one of the reasons that this question is challenging is that silence can mean so many different things right? Especially when it's coming from students. Some students are going to be silent because they've learned what we want them to learn, which is that it's okay to not speak

149
00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:49.110
Logan Smilges: right. And they're intentionally engaging silence as a way of allowing others to speak. And that's great but there are other times when students engage silence, because they, because it comes from a place

150
00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:52.099
Logan Smilges: of of discomfort

151
00:28:52.290 --> 00:29:15.740
Logan Smilges: when it comes from a place of insecurity. It comes from a place of perceived deficit where they don't feel they don't feel empowered to speak. They don't feel like they would be listened listened to, or maybe they're even afraid of forms of of retribution or response, were they to speak? And and so I think

152
00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:27.390
Logan Smilges: it's very important to always take silence in context.

153
00:29:28.855 --> 00:29:29.420
Logan Smilges: It.

154
00:29:30.010 --> 00:29:53.159
Logan Smilges: It can be really dangerous, actually, to form kind of universal theories of what silence means. And this is one of the critiques that I offer in queer silence of how a lot of the history of queer activism has been predicated on rather universal theories of silence as a bad thing.

155
00:29:53.430 --> 00:30:03.760
Logan Smilges: But of course, that that assumption does a lot of real damage to the multiplicity of silences.

156
00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:14.820
Logan Smilges: You asked specifically about online writing spaces. Were you thinking about like social media

157
00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:24.679
David Ornelas: That. Yes, of course. And just online work that's done that students have to do like for classic discussion boards or peer reviews, stuff like that

158
00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:29.340
Logan Smilges: Oh, my goodness! Well, what comes to mind

159
00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:35.732
Logan Smilges: with those examples? Like such a such as a discussion board?

160
00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:58.040
Logan Smilges: This is a great way to think about silence, not only as a kind of verbal absence, but as a kind of more multimodal gestural phenomenon, because, as every teacher who has taught online is familiar. There are many students who will use a lot of words to say absolutely nothing

161
00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:12.029
Logan Smilges: right? And this is this becomes all the more common when, as when as AI increasingly becomes commonplace. In students kind of

162
00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:15.540
Logan Smilges: composition practices and

163
00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:23.829
Logan Smilges: And so, while these forms of discoursing

164
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:34.109
Logan Smilges: are not silent in the sense that they're absent. They do engage a kind of silence in so far as they withhold

165
00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:38.970
Logan Smilges: a lot of depth. They withhold forms of

166
00:31:39.040 --> 00:32:02.829
Logan Smilges: engagement that we that we're hoping for from our students. And once again, I think that that withholding can mean a lot of different things. Sometimes, of course, students just don't want to do the work that's not unique to students. All of us don't want to do what our work sometimes, so I don't want to blame students too much for that.

167
00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:12.470
Logan Smilges: but it is the case. Sometimes students don't want to do the work other times. Other times, students. They have other priorities.

168
00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:25.781
Logan Smilges: you know, or similar to in class. They're not convinced that, you know, pouring their heart into a response is going to to offer them much

169
00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:30.058
Logan Smilges: much good, you know. And I think,

170
00:32:30.890 --> 00:32:38.900
Logan Smilges: I think we can learn a lot from students kind of forms of

171
00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:47.248
Logan Smilges: disengagement online. I think maybe disengagement is a nice kind of corollary to silence.

172
00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:51.750
Logan Smilges: because it it can teach us.

173
00:32:53.680 --> 00:33:00.630
Logan Smilges: It can teach us as educators how our students are perceiving

174
00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:02.580
Logan Smilges: the work that we've assigned them.

175
00:33:02.970 --> 00:33:06.099
Logan Smilges: the value that they see in that work.

176
00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:07.670
Logan Smilges: And

177
00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:18.710
Logan Smilges: while sometimes students just need needed, explain to them why certain work is important to do. Other times, I think, students.

178
00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:20.270
Logan Smilges: her.

179
00:33:20.810 --> 00:33:27.580
Logan Smilges: can we really onto something that what we assign them to do is perhaps not as useful to them

180
00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:31.827
Logan Smilges: as we would like to think it is and I think

181
00:33:32.370 --> 00:33:39.670
Logan Smilges: attending to their silences can be a really good kind of metric for us in that regard.

182
00:33:42.090 --> 00:33:50.899
David Ornelas: Thank you. And staying on the topic of digital communication. Early on in our interview I did talk about how I wrote about grandeur in my thesis at Sdsu.

183
00:33:51.600 --> 00:34:04.649
David Ornelas: And I focus on the ideal body of men. How must they achieve love through the app? How do you see digital communication platforms like Grindr, influencing the role of silence in queer and disabled rhetorics.

184
00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:11.949
David Ornelas: To to elaborate.

185
00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:27.330
David Ornelas: because we talked early on about how Grindr is well known for a hookup app, and it may be like the misconception from other people like, well, you know, I found love on here, but others saying, You know

186
00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:39.049
David Ornelas: it's just easy to meet with a guy within your area, and simple as that. But do you feel that influences the role of science and queer and disabled rhetorics

187
00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:54.159
Logan Smilges: Well, I think that I think that apps like grindr as a form.

188
00:34:54.679 --> 00:34:56.530
Logan Smilges: as a as a kind of

189
00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:11.470
Logan Smilges: as a platform on it like through which communication takes place. It provides certain conditions that

190
00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:16.929
Logan Smilges: structure, the kind of silence that is possible.

191
00:35:18.070 --> 00:35:21.570
Logan Smilges: So, for example.

192
00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:37.630
Logan Smilges: Grinder makes it possible for some queer people to engage in visual or embodied silences

193
00:35:37.790 --> 00:35:45.850
Logan Smilges: that they could not engage through other forms of communication, particularly those that are Irl.

194
00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:47.120
Logan Smilges: Right?

195
00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:52.210
Logan Smilges: So there there are some ways in which

196
00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:56.080
Logan Smilges: grinder makes more silence more possible.

197
00:35:57.610 --> 00:36:07.919
Logan Smilges: But there are other ways in which digital communication platforms, like Grindr can also restrict people's capacity for silence.

198
00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:18.873
Logan Smilges: Or, yeah, yeah, restrict people's capacity for silence and and I think this

199
00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:28.850
Logan Smilges: a good example of this is folks who, because

200
00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:36.449
Logan Smilges: they choose to engage in a kind of visual silence or embodied silence.

201
00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:42.060
Logan Smilges: they find it much more difficult to like, interact

202
00:36:42.250 --> 00:36:44.509
Logan Smilges: with other users on the app

203
00:36:44.970 --> 00:36:50.570
Logan Smilges: right. They are like verbally silenced because no one responds to their messages.

204
00:36:51.900 --> 00:37:09.069
Logan Smilges: And and I think that kind of that kind of silencing is a is not necessarily unique

205
00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:18.570
Logan Smilges: to the platform, because that also can occur. Irl, where people just like don't respond to you. It is nevertheless conditioned by the app.

206
00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:32.760
Logan Smilges: I guess. What I'm trying to say is that I I try to resist thinking about

207
00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:37.439
Logan Smilges: a single form of communication, as either like

208
00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:50.130
Logan Smilges: good or bad, for silence, and more so, simply altering the forms of absence that are possible.

209
00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:57.000
Logan Smilges: you know, in a, in a club or in a gay bar, there are.

210
00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:12.589
Logan Smilges: there are forms of silence that people can engage there, too, that are not possible on on an app, you know, and these one example that comes to mind for me is folks who

211
00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:17.080
Logan Smilges: are verbally silent, but are still dancing with people.

212
00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:24.960
Logan Smilges: and like making physical contact contact, and like making out and like. There are forms of embodied presence

213
00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:34.590
Logan Smilges: in person that require absolutely 0 verbal communication, whereas on an app like Grindr

214
00:38:34.830 --> 00:38:37.769
Logan Smilges: there's there's always a verbal foreplay.

215
00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:54.269
Logan Smilges: Right? You gotta set it up. And so yeah, I I like that. I like that. Your question uses the word influence like, how does it? How how do these platforms influence silence rather than simply

216
00:38:55.107 --> 00:38:57.019
Logan Smilges: create or constrain

217
00:38:58.110 --> 00:39:18.630
David Ornelas: No, I really like that example, because, like you said, you're in a club, and you're seeing someone in real life where on Grand or you're talking to, you know, sometimes a blank profile. You don't even know who you're talking to and like you said early on like that. That in itself is a form of talking. And amongst guys. So I really like that.

218
00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:22.510
David Ornelas: Thank you. As our last question.

219
00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:29.259
David Ornelas: how do you see your work, present and future, intersecting with emerging fields within fields, like digital humanities

220
00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:32.970
Logan Smilges: Oh, goodness! I was afraid you were. Gonna ask me this one.

221
00:39:33.350 --> 00:39:36.270
Logan Smilges: Well, I don't know if that's good or bad.

222
00:39:38.552 --> 00:39:42.320
Logan Smilges: The reason I was afraid is because I

223
00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:52.710
Logan Smilges: I'm not entirely certain. I know what the digital humanities refer to. I think that

224
00:39:53.140 --> 00:40:02.710
Logan Smilges: I am. I continue to be interested in the myriad ways that people find

225
00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:10.580
Logan Smilges: that that people adopt in in order to stay together and

226
00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:19.360
Logan Smilges: increasingly, in this kind of like ongoing pandemic world.

227
00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:36.880
Logan Smilges: Where, or forms of fascism are kind of spreading globally in terrifyingly quick ways.

228
00:40:39.730 --> 00:40:46.870
Logan Smilges: Technology is is a dominant way

229
00:40:47.090 --> 00:40:51.169
Logan Smilges: for people to stick together, for people to stay together.

230
00:40:51.770 --> 00:41:02.470
Logan Smilges: And so I find myself spending increasing amounts of time really studying and thinking about what

231
00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:18.314
Logan Smilges: certain digital platforms make possible and what they, what they constrict or constrain, you know. Just as I was saying with in regard to your last question about the the role of silence on these platforms,

232
00:41:19.450 --> 00:41:32.420
Logan Smilges: and something I something I've been trying to really work through in my head recently is the hmm.

233
00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:39.200
Logan Smilges: What seems to be a kind of shifting era

234
00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:42.589
Logan Smilges: in the world of social media.

235
00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:47.039
Logan Smilges: where a lot of the platforms that

236
00:41:47.160 --> 00:42:08.818
Logan Smilges: digital communities have grown accustomed to using in the last decade are are being abandoned. Platforms like Facebook platforms like Twitter, potentially, platforms like Tiktok, which continue to be legislated and in ways that make their their use very unreliable, you know.

237
00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:12.360
Logan Smilges: and it's also the case that

238
00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:24.340
Logan Smilges: in a lot of countries, platforms like Grindr are being heavily surveilled in ways that make them unusable for for queer people. So I

239
00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:31.620
Logan Smilges: I'm feeling as though we're in a really interesting moment where

240
00:42:32.020 --> 00:42:47.359
Logan Smilges: the way people are engaging technology to stay together is changing. And so, even though I don't feel as though I'm prepared to comment on the quality or

241
00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:52.290
Logan Smilges: form of those changes. I do think it is. It is a

242
00:42:52.830 --> 00:42:56.246
Logan Smilges: an ongoing interest of mine.

243
00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:06.679
Logan Smilges: I think it's also worth noting, too, that an increasing number of young people

244
00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:16.840
Logan Smilges: are not using social media at all. You know they've grown up with millennial parents who were always on their phones.

245
00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:17.635
Logan Smilges: and

246
00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:18.940
David Ornelas: Yeah.

247
00:43:19.070 --> 00:43:25.700
Logan Smilges: And, you know, have decided to adopt a kind of luddite aesthetic that

248
00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:31.124
Logan Smilges: for for very good reasons, just does not engage

249
00:43:31.900 --> 00:43:38.080
Logan Smilges: communication technologies in the same way. So I can't say for certain

250
00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:42.029
Logan Smilges: how my work is going to take up these changes.

251
00:43:43.525 --> 00:43:49.750
Logan Smilges: Admittedly, the the book projects I'm I'm working on now are not

252
00:43:50.010 --> 00:43:59.879
Logan Smilges: connected to these changes, but I can assure you there are things that I'm aware of and thinking about, and and will likely write about in the future

253
00:44:01.770 --> 00:44:04.070
David Ornelas: Awesome. Thank you so much for your time. Dr. Smolges.

254
00:44:04.070 --> 00:44:08.230
Logan Smilges: Of course I hope that my answers were helpful to you.

255
00:44:09.670 --> 00:44:10.370
David Ornelas: They were.
