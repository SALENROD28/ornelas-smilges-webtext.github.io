<h2>Transcript</h2>

<p><strong>Dr. Smilges:</strong> I guess I would say, one of the things that I'm really committed to in my work is thinking about how queerness doesn't always show up in the ways that we expect it to. And so I think that a lot of times when people are doing queer work or LGBTQ work, they're looking for markers of identity, right? So they're looking for people saying 'I'm gay' or 'I'm a lesbian' or what have you.</p>

<p><strong>David:</strong> Right.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Smilges:</strong> And for me, I'm interested in the ways that queerness shows up in things like failure and things like silence. I'm interested in the kinds of things that are often overlooked or dismissed. And so I think that queerness shows up in affective registers and relational registers and not just in identity. So that's kind of like the base of how I approach queerness in my work.</p>
